This code explores the relationships between Spotify API audio features and how various song types or genres correlate with streaming
activity across platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, TikTok, Pandora, and Shazam. By merging data from Spotify's API and a Kaggle dataset 
containing streaming statistics, I conducted an exploratory analysis to investigate the distribution of audio features and their connection 
to streaming behaviors. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering, I identified patterns that grouped songs into 
three distinct clusters based on certain audio features. These clusters were then analyzed to examine streaming performance across platforms, 
highlighting unique engagement patterns and suggesting how different user preferences shape listening behaviors. 
The results provide insights into how features like valence, energy, and acousticness impact a songâ€™s streaming performance across platforms.

Note: My spotify credentials were commented out. If trying to run the code for yourself, you will need to create your own credentials and input them in place of the "###"
